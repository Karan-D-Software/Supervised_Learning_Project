# Supervised_Learning_Project
In this project, we will try to find, analyze, and create an unsupervised machine-learning model to solve a problem. The data we will be using will be the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, this further adds to how supervised models can assist in medical problems.
