## Introduction 
In this project, we will try to find, analyze, and create an unsupervised machine-learning model to solve a problem. The data we will be using will be the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, this further adds to how supervised models can assist in medical problems. 

The data, a comprehensive collection of features for each sample, was meticulously gathered from images of FNA (Fine Needle Aspiration) of breast masses at the University of Wisconsin Hospital, Madison, by Dr. William H. Wolberg. This valuable dataset is publicly available on the reputable UCI Machine Learning Repository and Kaggle. 

## Objective
The goal of this project will be to classify breast cancer diagnoses as benign or malignant using the features given in the dataset. Throughout this project, we will explore Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, model training and evaluation of the said model to achieve optimal classification performance.
